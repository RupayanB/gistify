Google celebrates the 180th birth anniversary of Cuban physician and scientist Carlos Juan Finlay through a doodle on Tuesday. It has Carlos Juan Finlay's face amidst stagnant water, leaves and mosquitoes breeding on them. Google pays honour to the man who propounded the path-breaking theory that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. Finlay later theorised that the carrier of yellow fever was the mosquito Culex fasciatus,now known as Aedes aegypti.
