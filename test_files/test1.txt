Three U.S. Marines have died in al Anbar Province west of Baghdad, the Coalition Public Information Center said Tuesday. Al Anbar Province -- a hotbed for Iraqi insurgents -- includes the restive cities of Ramadi and Fallujah and runs to the Syrian and Jordanian borders. Meanwhile, officials said eight people died Monday in a U.S. air raid on a house in Fallujah that American commanders said was used to harbor Islamic militants. The strike was the latest in a series of raids on the city to target what U.S. military spokesmen have called safehouses for the network led by fugitive Islamic militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. At least four previous air raids have targeted suspected Zarqawi safehouses in Fallujah.
