US president Bill Clinton has arrived in Moscow for his first meeting with Russia's new president Vladmir Putin. High on the agenda will be the United State's plans to build a missile shield in Alaska. Russia opposes the shield as it contravenes a pact signed by the two countries in 1972 which bans any anti-missile devices. The Russian leader has said that he will suggest an alternative to the US system. Kremlin officials said Putin would propose a system that would shoot down the missiles with interceptors shortly after they were fired rather than high in their trajectory.
