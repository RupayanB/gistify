Emperor of Japan Akihito accompanied by Empress Michiko arrived in New Delhi on Saturday for a six-day visit described by the Government as “one of the biggest moments in India’s diplomatic engagement this year’’.

This was reflected in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife receiving the Japanese Royal couple at the airport. This was a rare gesture Dr. Singh had reserved for US President Barack Obama in 2010 and his predecessor George Bush in 2006.

It is the first time that the Emperor and Empress of Japan are coming to India and it is also a first that India has hosted the same two dignitaries on a state visit after a lapse of 50 years. “It has never happened before in the history of independent India,’’ pointed out Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.
