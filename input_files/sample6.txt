US president Bill Clinton has arrived in Moscow for his first meeting with Russia's new president Vladmir Putin.  The two heads of state will meet on Saturday night for an informal dinner before getting down to business on Sunday.

High on the agenda will be the United State's plans to build a missile shield in Alaska. Russia opposes the shield as it contravenes a pact signed by the two countries in 1972 which bans any anti-missile devices.

Clinton -- in his last few months of office and keen to make his mark in American history - will be seeking to secure some sort of concession from Putin.

The Russian leader has said that he will suggest an alternative to the US system.

Kremlin officials said Putin would propose a system that would shoot down the missiles with interceptors shortly after they were fired rather than high in their trajectory.

"We'll talk about it in Russia," Clinton told reporters before leaving Berlin for Moscow. "It won't be long now." Accompanying the President is US Secretary of State Madeline Albright. "What's new is that Putin is signalling that he is open to discuss it, that he is ready for talks," she said. "We will discuss it."

Arms control will not be the only potentially troublesome issue. US National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said last week Clinton would raise human rights and press freedom.
